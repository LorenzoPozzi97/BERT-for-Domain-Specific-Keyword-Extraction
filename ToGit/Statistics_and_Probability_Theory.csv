1,1,"['consequences', 'risk', 'probability', 'uncertainties']",Chapter  Engineering Decisions Under Uncertainty,seg_1,"• what is sustainability? • what is the role of engineering in society? • how can aspects of sustainability be related to life safety and cost optimal decision making? • what are the main different types of consequences to be considered in risk assessment? • why do possible conflicts exist between economy, safety and environment? • why is engineering decision making influenced by uncertainties? • what is the role of probability and consequence in decision making? • what is the definition of risk? • which are the main phases to be considered in life cycle risk assessments in engineering decision making?"
2,1,['sustainable'], Introduction,seg_3,"during the last two decades, there has been a growing awareness that our world only has limited non-renewable natural resources such as energy and materials but also limited renewable resources such as drinking water, clean air etc. this led the brundtland commission in 1987 to the conclusion that sustainable development is defined as a development “that meets the needs of the present without compromis-"
3,1,"['design', 'joint', 'sustainable']", Introduction,seg_3,"ing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. sustainable decision making is thus presently understood as based on a joint consideration of society, economy and environment. in regard to environmental impacts the immediate implications for the planning, design and operation of civil engineering infrastructures are clear: save energy, save non-renewable resources and find out about re-cycling of building materials, do not pollute the air, water or soil with toxic substances, save or even regain arable land and much more."
4,1,['replacement'], Introduction,seg_3,"for civil engineering infrastructure and facilities in general the financial aspect is also of crucial importance. civil engineering infrastructure is financed by the public via taxes, public charges or other. in the end, it is the individuals of society who pay and, of course, also enjoy the benefits derived from their existence. however, seen in the light of the conclusions of the brundtland report (brundtland [5]), intergenerational equity must be accounted for. our generation must not leave the burden of maintenance or replacement of too short-lived structures to future generations and it must not use more of the financial resources than those really available. in this sense, civil engineering facilities should be optimal not only from a technological point of view but also from a sustainability point of view."
5,1,"['cost benefit analysis', 'decision problem']", Introduction,seg_3,"it is in general a concern how society may maintain and even improve the quality of life. all activities in society should thus aim at improving the life expectancy and increasing the gross domestic product (gdp), resulting in the conclusion that investments into life saving activities must be in balance with the resulting increase in life expectancy. for the present, it is just stated that this problem constitutes a decision problem that can be analyzed using cost benefit analysis (see chap. 7)."
6,1,['risk'], Introduction,seg_3,"at present, approximately 10 to 20% of the gdp of developed countries is being re-invested into life saving activities such as public health, risk reduction and safety. for example, the economic burden of degradation of infrastructure amounted to about 10% of the gdp for the usa in 1997 (see alsalam et al. [1]). from these numbers it becomes apparent that the issue of safety and well being of the individuals in society as well as the durability of infrastructure facilities has a high importance for the performance of society and the quality of life."
7,1,"['design', 'case']", Introduction,seg_3,"the present book attempts to provide the basic tools for supporting decision making in the context of planning, design and maintenance of civil engineering activities and structures. engineering facilities such as bridges, power plants, dams and offshore platforms are all intended to benefit, in one way or another the quality of life of the individuals of society. therefore, whenever such a facility is planned, it is a prerequisite that the benefit of the facility can be proven considering all phases of the life of the facility, i.e. including design, manufacturing, construction, operation and eventually decommissioning. if this is not the case, clearly the facility should not be established."
8,1,['level'], Societal Decision Making and Risk,seg_5,on a societal level a beneficial engineered facility is normally understood as:
9,1,['efficient'], Societal Decision Making and Risk,seg_5,• being economically efficient in serving a specific purpose
10,1,['limit'], Societal Decision Making and Risk,seg_5,• fulfilling given requirements with regard to the safety of the personnel directly involved with or indirectly exposed to the facility • fulfilling given requirements to limit the adverse effects of the facility on the environment.
11,0,[], Societal Decision Making and Risk,seg_5,"based on these requirements, the ultimate task of the engineer is to make decisions or to provide the decision basis for others in order to ensure that engineered facilities are established in such a way as to provide the largest possible benefit."
12,1,"['associated', 'decision problem']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"consider as an example the decision problem of exploitation of hydraulic power. a hydraulic power plant project involving the construction of a water reservoir in a mountain valley is planned. the benefit of the hydraulic power plant is for simplicity assumed to be associated only with the monetary income from selling electricity to consumers. the decision problem thus is simplified to compare the costs of establishing, operating and eventually decommissioning the hydraulic power plant with the incomes to be expected during the service life of the plant. in addition, it must be ensured that the safety of the personnel involved in the construction and operation of the plant and the safety of third persons, i.e. the individuals of the society in general, is satisfactorily high."
13,1,"['efficiency', 'factors']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"different solutions for establishing the power plant may be considered and their efficiency can be measured in terms of the expected income relative to the cost of establishing the power plant. however, a number of factors are important for the evaluation of the income and the costs of establishing the power plant. these are e.g. the period of time when the plant will be operating and produce electricity and the capacity of the power plant. moreover, the future income from selling electricity will depend on the availability of water, which depends on the future snow and rainfall. further, the market situation may change and competing energy recourses such as thermal and solar power may cause a reduction of the market price on electricity in general."
14,1,"['failure', 'case']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"in addition, the different possible solutions for establishing the power plant will have different costs and different implications for the safety for persons. obviously, the more the capacity the power plant will have, the higher the dam and the larger the construction costs will be. at the same time, the potential flooding (consequence of dam failure) will be larger in case of dam failure and more people would be injured or die, see fig. 1.1."
15,1,['level'], Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"the safety of the people in a town downstream of the reservoir will also be influenced by the load carrying capacity of the dam structure relative to the pressure loading due to the water level in the reservoir. the strength of the dam structure depends in turn on the material characteristics of the dam structure and the properties of the soil and rock on which it is founded. as these properties are subject to uncertainty of various sources as shall be seen later, the load carrying capacity relative to"
16,1,"['failure', 'probability']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"the loading may be expressed in terms of the probability that the loading will exceed the load carrying capacity, or equivalently, the probability of dam failure."
17,1,"['range', 'level']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"finally, the environmental impact of the power plant will depend on the water level in the reservoir: the higher the water level, the more land will be flooded upstream of the dam structure and various habitats for animals and birds will be destroyed. on the other hand, the water reservoir itself will provide a living basis for new species of fish and birds and may provide a range of recreational possibilities for people such as sailing and fishing."
18,1,"['level', 'factors']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"in order to evaluate whether or not the power plant is feasible it is useful to make a list of the various factors influencing the benefit and their effects. as the problem may be recognized to be rather complex, only the interrelation of the water level in the reservoir with the following factors will be considered: the load carrying capacity of the dam structure, the costs of constructing the dam structure and the implications on the safety of the people living in a town down-stream the power plant."
19,1,"['factors', 'table']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"from table 1.1 which is clearly a simplified summary of the complex interrelations of the various factors influencing the benefit of realizing the power plant, it is seen that the various factors have different influences and that the different attributes"
20,1,"['consequences', 'risk', 'factors', 'table', 'failure', 'case', 'decision problem', 'probability', 'combinations', 'level']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"such as income, costs and safety are conflicting. in the table it is assumed that the medium load carrying capacity of the dam structure corresponds to a medium probability of dam failure but, of course, other combinations are also possible. consider the case with a high water level in the reservoir. in this case, the potential income is large but the costs of constructing the dam structure will also be high. furthermore, the potential consequences in case of dam failure will be large as well. table 1.1 clearly points to the true character of the decision problem, namely that the optimal decision depends on the consequences should something go wrong, and moreover, the probability that something goes wrong. the product of these two factors is called the risk, a measure that will be considered in much more detail in the chapters to follow."
21,1,"['uncertainty', 'uncertainties']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"furthermore, not only the load carrying capacity of the dam structure is associated with uncertainty, but, as indicated previously, also the income expected from the power plant, due to uncertainties in the future market situation. in a similar way, the costs of constructing the power plant are also uncertain as various difficulties encountered during the construction, such as unexpected rock formations, delay in construction works due to problems with material supplies, etc. may lead to additional costs."
22,1,"['consequences', 'factors', 'decision problem']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,when deciding on whether or not to establish the hydraulic power plant it is thus necessary to be able to assess consequences and probabilities—two key factors for the decision problem.
23,1,"['consequences', 'risk', 'probabilities', 'vary']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"both consequences and probabilities vary through the life of the power plant and this must be taken into account as well. in the planning phase it is necessary to consider the risk contributions from all subsequent phases of its life-cycle including decommissioning, see fig. 1.2."
24,1,"['failures', 'design', 'errors', 'events']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"it is important to recognize that different things may go wrong during the different phases of the service life, including events such as mistakes and errors during design and failures and accidents during construction, operation and decommissioning. the potential causes of errors, mistakes, failures and accidents may be numerous, including human errors, failures of structural components, extreme load situa-"

26,1,"['condition', 'factor', 'uncertainty', 'control', 'quality control']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,"as an illustration, the dam structure must be designed such that the safety of the dam is ensured in all phases of the service life, taking into account yet another factor of uncertainty, namely the future deterioration, but also the quality of workmanship, the degree of quality control implemented during construction and not least the foreseen strategies for the inspection and maintenance of the structures and mechanical equipment during the operation of the power plant. as a final aspect concerning the structures, these should at the end of the service life be in such a condition that the work to be performed during the decommissioning of the power plant can be performed safely for both the persons involved and the environment."
27,1,"['uncertainty', 'decision problem']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,a final fundamental problem arises with regard to the question—how large are the acceptable risks?—what is one prepared to invest and/or pay for the purpose of getting a potential benefit? the decision problem of whether or not to establish the hydraulic power plant is thus seen to be a decision problem involving a significant element of uncertainty.
28,1,"['risk', 'probabilities', 'decision theory', 'treatment', 'uncertainty', 'decision problems']", Example Feasibility of Hydraulic Power Plant,seg_7,the mathematical basis for the treatment of such decision problems is known as decision theory. important aspects of decision theory are the assessment of consequences and probabilities. in a very simplified manner one can say that risk and reliability analysis in civil engineering is concerned with the problem of decision making subject to uncertainty.
29,1,"['risk', 'likelihood', 'probability']", Definition of Risk,seg_9,"in daily conversation risk is a rather common notion used interchangeably with words like chance, likelihood and probability to indicate that people are uncertain about the state of the activity, item or issue under consideration. for example, the risk of getting cancer due to cigarette smoking is discussed, the chance of succeeding to develop a vaccine against the hiv virus in 2020, the likelihood of getting a “royal flush” in a poker game and the probability of a major earthquake occurring in the bay area of san francisco within the next decade."
30,1,"['consequences', 'risk', 'associated']", Definition of Risk,seg_9,"even though it may be understandable from the context of the discussion what is meant by the different words, it is necessary in the context of engineering decision making that those involved are precise in the understanding of risk. risk is to be understood as the expected consequences associated with a given activity, the activity being e.g. the construction, operation and decommissioning of a power plant."
31,1,"['consequences', 'risk', 'probability', 'event']", Definition of Risk,seg_9,considering an activity with only one event with potential consequences c the risk r is the probability that this event will occur p multiplied with the consequences given the event occurs i.e.:

45,1,"['experiment', 'trials', 'probability of an event', 'frequency', 'experimentalist', 'probability', 'event', 'experiments']", Frequentistic Definition,seg_19,"the frequentistic definition of probability is the typical interpretation of probability by the experimentalist. in this interpretation the probability p(a) is simply the relative frequency of occurrence of the event a as observed in an experiment with n trials, i.e. the probability of an event a is defined as the number of times that the event a occurs divided by the number of experiments that are carried out:"

47,1,"['experiments', 'probability']", Frequentistic Definition,seg_19,"if a frequentist is asked what is the probability of achieving a “head” when flipping a coin, she/he would principally not know what to answer until she/he would have performed a large number of experiments. if say after 1000 experiments (flips with the coin) it is observed that “head” has occurred 563 times, the answer would be that the probability of achieving a “head” is 0.563. however, as the number of experiments is increased the probability would converge towards 0.5. in the mind of a frequentist, probability is a characteristic of nature."

49,1,"['probability', 'probability of the event', 'event']", Classical Definition,seg_21,1 culus was founded by pascal and fermat. the inspiration for this theory can be found in the games of cards and dice. the classical definition of the probability of the event a can be formulated as:
50,1,['experiment'], Classical Definition,seg_21,"na = number of equally likely ways by which an experiment may lead to a, ntot = total number of equally likely ways in the experiment."
51,1,"['experiment', 'probability', 'outcomes']", Classical Definition,seg_21,"according to the classical definition of probability, the probability of achieving a “head” when flipping a coin would be 0.5 as there is only one possible way to achieve a “head” and there are two equally likely outcomes of the experiment."

53,1,['experiment'], Classical Definition,seg_21,• the experiment does not need to be carried out as the answer is known in advance. • the classical theory gives no solution unless all equally possible ways can be derived analytically.
54,1,"['bayesian', 'probability', 'event']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,in the bayesian interpretation the probability p(a) of the event a is formulated as a degree of belief that a will occur:
55,1,"['bayesian', 'probability']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,"coming back to the coin-flipping problem the bayesian would argue that there are two possibilities, and as she has no preferences as to “head” or “tail” she would judge the probability of achieving a “head” to be 0.5."
56,1,"['bayesian', 'probabilities', 'probability', 'event', 'subjective']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,"the degree of belief is a reflection of the state of mind of the individual person in terms of experience, expertise and preferences. in this respect the bayesian interpretation of probability is subjective or more precise—person-dependent. this opens up the possibility that two different persons may assign different probabilities to a given event and thereby contradicts the frequentist interpretation that probabilities are a characteristic of nature."
57,1,"['bayesian', 'symmetry', 'probability', 'experiments', 'statistical']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,the bayesian statistical interpretation of probability includes the frequentistic and the classical interpretation in the sense that the subjectively assigned probabilities may be based on experience from previous experiments (frequentistic) as well as considerations of e.g. symmetry (classical).
58,1,"['bayesian', 'prior belief', 'treatment', 'bayesian statistics', 'statistics', 'prior probability', 'probability']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,"the degree of belief is also referred to as a prior belief or prior probability, i.e. the belief, which may be assigned prior to obtaining any further knowledge. it is interesting to note that immanuel kant2 developed the philosophical basis for the treatment of subjectivity at the same time as thomas bayes3 developed the mathematical framework later known as bayesian statistics."
59,1,"['bayesian', 'risk', 'data', 'degree of freedom', 'probability', 'subjective']", Bayesian Definition,seg_23,"modern structural reliability and risk analysis is based on the bayesian interpretation of probability. however, the degree of freedom in the assignment of probabilities is in reality not as large as indicated in the above. in a formal bayesian framework the subjective element should be formulated before the relevant data are observed. arguments of objective symmetrical reasoning and physical constraints, of course, should be taken into account."

61,1,"['bayesian', 'cases', 'probability']", Practical Implications of the Different Interpretations of Probability,seg_25,"in other cases when the considered components are e.g. bridges, high-rise buildings, ship structures or unique configurations of pipelines and pressure vessels, these conditions are not fulfilled. this is because the number of identical structures may be very small (or even just one) and the conditions in terms of operational and loading conditions are normally significantly different from structure to structure. in such situations, the bayesian interpretation of probability is far more appropriate."
62,1,"['bayesian', 'bayesian statistics', 'uncertainty', 'statistics', 'probabilistic', 'process']", Practical Implications of the Different Interpretations of Probability,seg_25,"the basic idea behind bayesian statistics is that lack of knowledge should be treated by probabilistic reasoning, similarly to other types of uncertainty. in reality, decisions have to be made despite the lack of knowledge and probabilistic tools are a great help in this process."

987,0,[],A Chapter ,seg_263,• the roof may collapse (due to various reasons) • the roof will not collapse (survival of the roof)
988,1,"['events', 'probability', 'associated', 'event']",A Chapter ,seg_263,these events are associated with some probability as shown in the event tree branches:
989,0,[],A Chapter ,seg_263,hence the expected cost of this action is:
