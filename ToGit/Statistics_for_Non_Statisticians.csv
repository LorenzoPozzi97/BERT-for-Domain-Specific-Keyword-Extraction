1,1,"['data collection', 'data']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"statistics can be defined as a collection of techniques used when planning a data collection, and when subsequently analyzing and presenting data."
2,1,"['statistics', 'probability theory', 'probability', 'population', 'statistical']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"dating back to ancient times people have needed knowledge about population size, to carry out a census of the armies or calculate expected taxes. the word statistics is derived from the word “status” (originally coming from latin); and it was exactly the status of society, which was the subject of the first statistics! later emerged probability theory (in connection with games!), demographics and insurance science as areas, in which statistical thinking was essential."
3,1,"['process', 'statistics', 'data']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"in today’s digital age it is easy to collect as well as process and disseminate data, and therefore statistics is used for a variety of surveys throughout society."
4,1,['statistical'],Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,most statistical surveys can be divided into the following phases:
5,1,"['data collection', 'data']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,1. clarification of concepts 2. planning of data collection 3. data collection 4. analysis and presentation of data 5. conclusion
6,1,['statisticians'],Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,statistical methods (and statisticians!) are particularly useful in phases 2 and 4 of the survey.
7,1,['statistics'],Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,there are two kinds of statistics:
8,1,"['descriptive statistics', 'statistics']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,– descriptive statistics – analytical statistics
9,1,"['statistics', 'data', 'statistical', 'tables', 'percentages', 'charts']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"descriptive statistics means describing data using tables, charts and simple statistical calculations such as averages, percentages, etc. this is what many people understand by the word “statistics”. it was also the kind of statistics that was produced in ancient times."
10,1,"['estimate', 'statistics', 'data', 'probability']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"analytical statistics is used to assess differences and relationships in data. for example, we could examine whether there is a relation between height and weight of a group of persons; or whether there is a difference between height of boys and height of girls, as well as provide an estimate of how large this difference is. analytical statistics is a mathematical discipline, based on calculus of probability. it is a relatively new discipline that has been developed throughout the twentieth century."
11,1,"['descriptive statistics', 'statistics']",Chapter  Data Collection,seg_1,"this book is about descriptive statistics as well as analytical statistics. in practice, you need both. analytical statistics is a very large topic, and here we can only scratch the surface (see especially chaps. 5, 7, and 8). if you want to know more about analytical statistics, see some of the more advanced books in the literature list."
12,1,"['sample', 'data', 'information', 'sample ', 'population']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,"in any survey (*), we collect information on the individuals of either the entire population (*) (a total survey) or a relatively small number of individuals of a sample (*) (a sample survey), in order to analyze and present data."
13,1,"['sample', 'results', 'population']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,"we are interested in the entire population of individuals. the advantage of investigating only a sample is that it is both faster and cheaper than investigating the whole population. in some situations, a carefully planned sample survey can even give more accurate results than a badly planned total survey!"
14,1,"['sample', 'estimate', 'population']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,we investigate the individuals in the sample in order to study the whole population! this means that the sample gives us an estimate (*) of the characteristics of the population (fig. 1.1).

17,1,"['sample', 'sampling ', 'estimate', 'sampling', 'population', 'random', 'representative']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,"the larger the sample, the better an estimate of the population! it is also important that the sample is representative of the population. in practice, this means that the individuals in the sample are selected at random, in order to cover the whole population. we are dealing much more with sampling (*) in chap. 6."
18,1,"['sample', 'population']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,"the sample (and the population) may consist of different types of individuals, depending on the context."
19,1,['samples'], Sample Surveys,seg_3,the concepts in this book can be applied to all types of samples. the examples are mainly samples consisting of people. but the principles can be applied to all types of samples.
20,1,['samples'], Sample Surveys,seg_3,"typical applications with samples consisting of people are: analysis of attitudes, consumption, durable goods, interests and hobbies, eating and drinking habits, transportation, traffic, vacation, media (tv, radio, newspapers) and certain sensitive topics, such as alcohol consumption."
21,1,['sample'], Sample Surveys,seg_3,"sample surveys can provide a high degree of flexibility: one can in the same survey have questions on media consumption, traffic patterns and attitudes. sample surveys are also widely used in commercial surveys, e.g., in connection with telephone interviews."
22,1,"['sampling', 'control', 'statistical', 'quality control']", Sample Surveys,seg_3,"one of the essential applications of sampling is sampling inspection in the field of statistical quality control. if you are working with statistical quality control, most of this book will be relevant to you. the issues that are specific to this discipline, however, will not be dealt with here. see the literature list for books on statistical quality control."
23,0,[], Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,this example is fictitious survey. it will be used as an example for the subsequent chapters.
24,1,['loss'], Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,"fitness club has a number of sports facilities. this includes facilities for strength training, weight loss and cardiovascular workout."
25,1,['information'], Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,"fitness club wants to understand the needs of their young customers, kids of age 12–17 years. the club wants to know, how satisfied these kids are with the sports facilities. they also want to obtain information about their health in order to better customize the sports facilities for the various types of training."
26,1,['sample'], Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,"therefore, a sample survey is carried out among the kids using the sports facilities. we will later discuss how the survey can be organized. moreover, we present some findings from the survey."
27,1,"['sample', 'population']", Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,the population consists of kids using the sports facilities in fitness club. the individual is one kid. the sample consists of 30 kids.
28,1,['data'], Fitness Club Example of a Sample Survey,seg_5,some data related to this example are found in the appendices in chap. 9 of this book.
29,1,"['factors', 'experiment', 'design', 'experiment ', 'data', 'case', 'information', 'test']", Experiments,seg_7,"in certain situations, the information needed simply does not exist at all! in this case, one can plan (or design) an experiment (*), with the aim to provide the relevant data. in the experiment, we test the influence of one or more factors on a measured result. this approach is widely used in technical and industrial contexts."
30,1,"['sample', 'experimental', 'experiment', 'results', 'population', 'experiments']", Experiments,seg_7,"in these situations the population is not well defined. the experiment can produce very different results, depending on how it is planned. nevertheless, it also makes sense to talk about a sample in this situation. we can perceive the experimental results as a sample of all the (infinitely many) possible results we could have obtained in all similar experiments."
31,1,"['sample', 'experiment', 'data', 'statistical']", Experiments,seg_7,"the statistical techniques used to analyze and present data are by and large the same, regardless of whether data are collected in a sample survey or an experiment."
32,1,['experiments'], Experiments,seg_7,"the special techniques used in the planning of experiments will not be dealt with in this book; the space does not allow this. there are numerous books on this topic, see the literature list."
33,1,"['sample', 'experiment']", Experiments An Example,seg_9,"to illustrate the difference between a sample survey and an experiment, we present an example of a planned experiment."
34,0,[], Experiments An Example,seg_9,a producer of soft drinks wants to launch a new product with an entirely new blend of flavor ingredients. he is uncertain how to balance the flavors with
35,1,"['experiment', 'combinations']", Experiments An Example,seg_9,"carbonate and sugar. he therefore performs an experiment, where he is testing various combinations of the ingredients."
36,0,[], Experiments An Example,seg_9,"the producer makes a list with the lowest respectively highest value added of the three ingredients, which he expects to use."
37,1,"['experimental', 'table', 'sets', 'combinations']", Experiments An Example,seg_9,then he sets an experimental plan. he makes a few bottles of product of each of the eight possible combinations of the three ingredients (table 1.1).
38,1,['rates'], Experiments An Example,seg_9,"here “1” means add “a little” of the ingredient, while “2” means add “a lot”. a taste panel of ten persons tastes all bottles and rates them. they use a scale of 1–7, where 4 is “neither good nor bad,” 1 is “unusually poor,” 7 is “unusually good”."
39,1,"['combination', 'experiment', 'table', 'results', 'combinations', 'average', 'rates']", Experiments An Example,seg_9,"the average rating for each combination is shown in the last column of the table. afterwards the manufacturer studies the results of the experiment. he observes that the four combinations with a “high” value of the flavor have better rates than the four combinations with a “low” value of the flavor. the average of the four combinations with a “high” value is 4.95, and the average of the four combinations with a “low” value is only 3.38. it would therefore appear that a lot of the flavor ingredient must be added."
40,0,[], Experiments An Example,seg_9,"by calculating the other averages, he can see that it is not so important, how much carbonate and sugar is added. he therefore chooses to add an intermediate dose of carbonate and sugar."
41,1,['case'], Experiments An Example,seg_9,"experiments of this type are widely used in industry, but they can also be used in marketing (as in this case) and social sciences."
42,1,"['sample', 'experiment', 'results', 'data']", Data Collection,seg_11,"we have now seen the difference between sample surveys and planned experiments. in the next chapter, we show how to present results from a sample survey or an experiment. first, however, we see how data are collected."
43,1,"['error', 'data', 'sources of error', 'populations', 'data collection']", Data Collection,seg_11,"most of the book describes general techniques that can be applied to all types of populations. populations consisting of or involving humans are probably what will interest most readers of this book. that is why the rest of this chapter is on data collection methods, questionnaires and various sources of error for surveys of populations consisting of or involving people; for example, populations of enterprises, institutions or families."
44,1,['population'], Data Collection,seg_11,"if your population is not of this type, you can skip the rest of this chapter. the rest of the book will be useful, regardless of the type of population you are dealing with."
45,1,"['sample', 'register', 'information', 'varying']", Registers,seg_13,"before planning a sample survey, one should always check if the necessary information already exists in a database. a database consisting of people is often called a register. the vast majority of enterprises, institutions and organizations possess one or more databases with “business data”; for example member databases, customer databases, etc. it is varying from organization to organization, how much information on each individual these databases contain."
46,1,"['register', 'results', 'data', 'information', 'statistical']", Registers,seg_13,"if a register contains the information you need, it is often relatively simple to produce the desired statistical results. this is simply reuse of data already collected for administrative purposes!"
47,1,"['sample', 'register', 'population']", Registers,seg_13,"this will most often be done on the whole population, as it rarely is more difficult than making an investigation on only a sample of the individuals in the register. therefore, register surveys are nearly always total surveys."
48,1,"['sample', 'registers', 'information']", Registers,seg_13,"briefly, you should use registers, when the information needed is available in an appropriate form, and you have access to it. on the other hand, you will use sample surveys, where registers do not exist, are inadequate, or you do not have access to them."
49,1,"['sample', 'register', 'information']", Registers,seg_13,"if the register does not contain the desired information, it can often be used as the basis for selecting a sample. sometimes, a register survey is combined with a sample survey. the register provides part of the requested information, the rest you get through the sample survey."
50,1,"['registers', 'register', 'information', 'population', 'statistical']", Registers,seg_13,"examples of register surveys are found in many research projects in the social sciences. one can use the information from the administrative registers for many purposes. the national statistical institutes in many countries have access to the registers, providing valuable information on the entire population of a nation."
51,0,[], Questionnaire Surveys,seg_15,a questionnaire survey has three parties:
52,0,[], Questionnaire Surveys,seg_15,"– a researcher, who formulates the questions. – an interviewer, who asks the questions. – a respondent, who answers the questions."
53,1,['results'], Questionnaire Surveys,seg_15,"the usefulness of the results from a questionnaire survey depends on, whether the researcher formulates the questions in a way that ensures effective communication between the interviewer and the respondent!"
54,0,[], Questionnaire Surveys,seg_15,there are two main types of questions:
55,1,"['tables', 'results']", Background Questions,seg_17,"this could be sex, age, marital status, type of accommodation, residence, education, employment, annual income, etc. these questions are used to group results in tables and graphs."
56,1,"['distribution', 'tables']", Background Questions,seg_17,"for example you create tables, where you study the distribution of the answer to a question across different groups (e.g., age groups). more can be found on this in chaps. 2 and 5."
57,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,they constitute the body of the questionnaire.
58,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,a few examples:
59,0,['e'], Study Questions,seg_19,(a) are you in favor of or against nuclear power? (b) were you employed last week? (c) how many nights in a hotel did you have last year? (d) what was your annual income last year? (e) do you think the prime minister is doing a good job?
60,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,it is important to distinguish between closed and open questions:
61,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,1. closed questions are of the type:
62,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,what education do you have?
63,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,– elementary education – apprentice/technical education – secondary education – higher education
64,1,"['data', 'categories']", Study Questions,seg_19,"there are, in other words, a limited number of categories (often only two, such as yes/no). the advantage is that it is easy to handle the data processing afterwards, because it is not necessary to do any “recoding” of the responses. the disadvantage is that the respondent may not find the right answer option. 2. open questions are of the type:"
65,1,"['categories', 'data']", Study Questions,seg_19,what education do you have? respondents have the opportunity towrite any free text.the advantage is that the respondent always has an answer option. the disadvantage is that it is cumbersome and time consuming to handle the data processing afterwards: a personwith subject matter knowledge must “code” the free text into well-defined categories. 3. semi-closed questions are of the type:
66,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,what education do you have?
67,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,– elementary education – apprentice/technical education – secondary education
68,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"this is just a closed question, which has an “other” category with the opportunity to write free text. this combines the best from the closed and open questions."
69,1,"['categories', 'response']", Study Questions,seg_19,many questions in questionnaires express an assessment. there are a number of ordered response categories.
70,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,an example: what do you think about the course?
71,1,['categories'], Study Questions,seg_19,"the number of categories in this kind of question is a topic of much discussion. there is consensus that the number of categories should not be too big and not too small either! approximately three to seven categories is probably the best, five answer categories is perhaps most commonly used."
72,1,['categories'], Study Questions,seg_19,"on the other hand, many people prefer an even number of categories. it is based on an idea that an odd number of categories (for example 5) encourage the respondent to choose the middle category, because it is convenient. therefore, many prefer four or maybe six answer categories."
73,1,"['risk', 'biased']", Study Questions,seg_19,"introduction questions are used now and then, particularly with complex issues, where the respondent needs to be “guided” in the topic. it is very important to be careful with the wording of these questions, otherwise you run the risk of being biased (“leading questions”). the risk of influencing the respondents is simply too big. there exist several examples on this in connection with, e.g., polls."
74,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"deliberately influencing the respondent in order to provide a certain answer is (hopefully!) a rare exception, although it certainly occurs."
75,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"control questions are used to ensure that the respondent has understood the questions and answered honestly, e.g., within a very complicated and sensitive issue."
76,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"you therefore ask the “same” question in a new wording. or you ask a supplementary question, which may shed light on the responses to some of the key questions of the study."
77,1,['control'], Study Questions,seg_19,"an example from a survey, in which people were asked about their alcohol consumption the day before: the following control question was asked:"
78,1,"['distribution', 'table']", Study Questions,seg_19,"do you normally drink more, the same or less? the distribution of the answers is given in table 1.2."
79,1,['case'], Study Questions,seg_19,"the interviews were evenly spread over all weekdays and all months of 1 year! thus, there should be a roughly equal number of people, who normally drink more respectively less. this was not the case, because the respondents want to appear not to drink too much. this may indicate that the respondents did not answer honestly!"
80,1,['risk'], Study Questions,seg_19,it is very important not to ask too many questions! there is a tendency to ask a lot of redundant questions just “out of curiosity”. this bores the respondent and increases the risk that the respondent will skip the last questions. maybe those questions were essential?
81,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"a basic requirement for the questionnaire is to ensure a clear communication, i.e., the use of simple and clear formulations. keep it simple!"
82,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,it is important that the researcher when formulating the questions tries to put himself in the respondent’s place. keep in mind that the respondent is not an expert!
83,1,"['categories', 'results']", Study Questions,seg_19,"if the results of the questionnaire are to be compared with results from other questionnaires, care must be taken to ensure comparability. this means that you pose the same questions and use the same answer categories as in the other surveys."
84,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"remember to always ask about one thing at a time. it may be tempting to put two issues together in one question, but the result is rarely good."
85,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,an example from real life is the following question: are you shopping
86,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"here, the researcher is dealing with two issues:"
87,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,(a) whether the respondent is responsible for a large or small proportion of
88,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,purchases in the household. (b) whether the respondent is alone or together with others when shopping.
89,0,[], Study Questions,seg_19,"the result was, that many men answered “alone” because they buy things for themselves, for example in a kiosk. on the other hand, many women answered “together with others” because they bring their children when shopping in the supermarket. the purpose of the question was to identify the person responsible for most of the shopping in the household."
90,1,['test'], Study Questions,seg_19,it is always a good idea to test the questions on a few people in order to see if they are understood and are answered without problems. the respondents might be “friends and relatives”! such a study (known as a pilot study) can detect many problems before it is too late!
91,1,"['results', 'case', 'errors', 'data', 'data collection']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"regardless of how data are collected in a questionnaire, problems may arise, which in the worst case may influence the results significantly. there may be errors that come from the question wording and errors arising from the data collection."
92,1,['errors'], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,many errors in surveys come from problems with the wording of the questions. this can be
93,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"– unclear questions. – people cannot or will not respond, they do not know, etc. – unconscious influence on the respondent, e.g., in connection with “intro- duction questions.”"
94,1,['errors'], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,these errors can only avoided by a careful wording of the questions!
95,1,"['data', 'data collection']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,non-response (*) is another major problem. this means that some respondents do not participate in the survey. this may be due to problems in the data collection.
96,1,"['results', 'average', 'mean']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"non-response may mean that the results of the survey are misleading! for example, it is often difficult (both by telephone interview and by visit) to catch the “busy businessman,” who is seldom at home (working more hours per week than the average). if you are not working hard to reach this group of respondents, it is obvious that the survey results will be “unbalanced”."
97,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,the two most frequent causes of non-response are:
98,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"– people are not at home, or not reached (by telephone interview or visits). – refusal: people may simply ignore any attempt of contact."
99,1,"['rate', 'response']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"the only solution to not reaching people is tomake numerous attempts of contact (telephone calls, visits, etc.). typically you should make attempts both in the weekend and on weekdays, both in daytime and evening hours, if you want to increase the response rate. this means at least four contact attempts, which of course is costly..."
100,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"the problem with refusal is growing as the number of more or less dubious marketing companies increases, which again increases the number of phone calls to each household. people have simply had enough!"
101,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"the problem is of course impossible to avoid completely. however, it is possible to reduce it:"
102,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"– first of all, proper training of the interviewers is important, so that they can"
103,0,[], Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"better cope with “troublesome” respondents. – one can also offer the respondents a reward (e.g., a lottery ticket) for participat-"
104,1,"['data', 'data collection']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,ing in the survey. – combining multiple data collection methods (for instance telephone interviews
105,1,"['rate', 'response']", Sources of Errors in Surveys,seg_21,"and visits) can also provide a higher response rate. this again increases the costs, however."
106,1,"['data collection', 'data']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,the main types of data collection in surveys are:
107,1,"['data collection', 'data']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"– internet, e-mail or other electronic data collection (e.g., text messages on mobile phones) – mail questionnaire – telephone interviews – personal interview (“visit” or “face-to-face” interview)"
108,1,"['data', 'data collection', 'method']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"when selecting a data collection method, you should obviously evaluate both cost and quality."
109,0,[], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"usually, there is a relationship between cost and quality! the above list is roughly arranged in order of increasing cost and quality. thus internet or e-mail questionnaires are cheap, while personal interviews are expensive."
110,1,['rate'], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"the quality depends largely on the non-response rate, i.e., proportion of respondents who do not participate. the non-response rate is considerable by internet or email; by personal interviews it is much smaller."
111,1,"['errors', 'data collection', 'data', 'process']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"errors in data are also a quality issue. the traditional mail questionnaire gives no opportunity to correct errors during the interviewing process, as do the other data collection types."
112,1,"['interaction', 'data', 'data collection']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"the first two methods of data collection are carried out without an interviewer, while there is an interviewer present with the last two methods. the interaction between interviewer and respondent in the last two data collection methods has both advantages and disadvantages that can affect quality:"
113,0,[], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"– advantage: the interviewer can help the respondent, if there is any doubt about"
114,0,[], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"what is meant by a question. this can reduce the number of questions that are not answered (or answered by “do not know”, etc.). – disadvantage: the interviewer may unconsciously affect the respondent’s"
115,1,['risk'], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"answer in a certain direction. this risk is largest in personal interviews, but can be minimized by careful training of interviewers."
116,1,"['data', 'factor', 'data collection', 'method']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"another key factor in the choice of data collection method is the questionnaire’s length, i.e., number of questions."
117,1,"['data', 'mean', 'data collection']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"the first two data collection methods should not be used for very long questionnaires, where the respondent’s (lack of) patience will often mean “less serious” (or no!) replies."
118,1,"['data', 'data collection']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"the last two data collection methods involve a direct contact between interviewer and respondent. the talented interviewer can exploit this, if a respondent is becoming impatient."
119,1,['factor'], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"the possibility of “previewing” is yet another factor to take into account. in personal interviews different visual effects, which can help the respondent to understand a difficult issue, can be shown. by telephone interview audio files can"
120,0,[], Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"be played during the interview. in mail questionnaires one can display pictures. finally, in internet interviews “almost everything” is possible by taking advantage of modern technology."
121,1,"['rate', 'method', 'combination', 'data', 'response', 'data collection']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"often you will use a combination of two data collection methods. one collection method (often telephone) is used for most interviews. for the reminders is used a second data collection method, e.g., personal interview. the skilled interviewer can better persuade a respondent to participate in the survey. this can be used to achieve a higher response rate."
122,1,"['results', 'information']", Comparing Methods of Data Collection,seg_23,"also, this enables an assessment of whether there is a difference in the results among those who answered respectively did not answer in the first round. this provides information on the validity of the survey results."
123,1,"['sample', 'register', 'information', 'process']", Example Continued,seg_25,"fitness club has a register of all customers. this register contains contact information (name, address, etc.) as well as information on sex and age of all customers; this makes it easy to extract a sample of customers in the age group 12–17 for a survey. we will discuss the process of selecting a sample in chap. 6."
124,0,[], Example Continued,seg_25,"fitness club chooses to send a mail questionnaire to all the selected customers. it is a relatively inexpensive solution. a disadvantage is that for instance the questions about their health are answered subjectively. this is, indeed, a common feature of most questionnaire surveys!"
125,1,['rates'], Example Continued,seg_25,"another drawback is that such surveys often lead to high non-response rates. to reduce this problem, fitness club encloses a stamped addressed envelope. also, the customers responding will participate in a lottery, where they can win smart mobile phones and other electronic gadgets, which are particularly attractive to kids of this age group."
126,1,"['tables', 'results']",Chapter  Presentation of Data,seg_27,"in this chapter we show how to present the results of a questionnaire survey, using graphs and tables."
127,1,"['plots', 'data', 'errors', 'combinations', 'statistical', 'charts']",Chapter  Presentation of Data,seg_27,"graphs (charts, plots, etc.) are suited to get a feel of patterns, structures, trends and relationships in data and thus are an invaluable supplement to a statistical analysis. they are also useful tools to find unlikely (e.g., extremely large or extremely small) data values or combinations of data values (such as a very high person who does not weigh much), which may be errors in the data."
128,0,[],Chapter  Presentation of Data,seg_27,"it is easy to create graphs with a spreadsheet, such as microsoft excel or open office calc. here, only the main types of graphs are covered. there are many other types of graphs than those shown here. see the “help” menu in your spreadsheet to see the possibilities!"
129,1,['data'],Chapter  Presentation of Data,seg_27,"tables are another way of presenting data, which is also discussed briefly here."
130,1,"['table', 'charts', 'information']", Bar Charts,seg_29,bar charts are familiar to most people. they conveniently summarize information from a table in a clear and illustrative manner.
131,1,"['loss', 'average', 'table']", Bar Charts,seg_29,"let us consider an example from the “fitness club” survey. as one focus of the young customers is weight loss, a table of average height and weight by sex is interesting. it may, in tabular form look as shown in table 2.1."
